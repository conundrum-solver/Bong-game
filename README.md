# Bong-game
 
Welcome to my Pong game project, created as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Pong is a classic arcade game that simulates table tennis, and I'm excited to share my implementation with you.

## Getting Started
To play my Pong game, follow these simple steps:
- Run the Python script main.py
- Controls: Use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to control the right paddle and the W and S keys to control the left paddle.
- Gameplay: The goal is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle. Earn points each time you successfully do so.
- Speedup: The speed of the ball will continue to increase until one of the players misses the ball. The ball speed will then reset.
